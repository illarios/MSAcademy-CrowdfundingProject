# Crowdfund

You have been given the opportunity to work for a big client. The task
at hand is to **create a crowdfunding platform** (like [KickStarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/) 
or [Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/)) for the Web where one, **the Project Creator**, could
share their wildest idea and others, **the backers**, could contribute
financially to see it happening.

The Project Creator promotes his idea through a custom **project
profile page** where he can **add** a **project title**, **Description**, **photos**,
**videos** and **post status updates**, whenever necessary.

In addition to that, the Project Creator should be able to **track 
the project's financial progress** through his Dashboard page.
To motivate backers to contribute, he/she should **offer a number 
of funding packages** where each package is accompanied by a
reward to the backer.

A backer should be able to **browse all Projects** and **invest on any one
he wishes**. He can **find Projects either through plain text search** or by
**browsing by category**, and he should be able to **view the site's
trending projects**. He/she should also be able to **view the projects he
funded** and observe their progress.

Your client wishes to create a proof of concept of the application, with separate
screens for the Project Creator and the backer (authorization not required for the
proof of concept), enabling him to showcase it's usage to [Angel Investors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_investor) to receive funding.

#### Hard requirements:
1) Create a new project (Project creator)
2) Add reward packages (Project creator)
3) Fund a project by selecting a reward package (backer)
4) View list of available projects (backer)
5) View Project's page (backer & Project Creator)
6) View a list of funded projects (backer & Project Creator)
7) Provide a REST API allowing third party integrations.

> As always, the project's source code must be **delivered on github**,
> and all **coding and architectural standards** discussed in classroom
> **applied**.
